# Moodvie  

## Description:
Moodvie is a choose-your-own-adventure meets personalized movie generator game. When you donâ€™t know what to watch next, Moodvie can help you find your new or old favorite flick. I love watching movies, so I was excited to find a way to incorporate some of my favorite characters into this project in a creative way. I was inspired by the book, 'Film Club' written by David Gilmour, a memoir about the 3 years he let his teenage son drop out of school if he watched 3 movies a week. My goal was to create a fun, interactive game that could help people, non-cinephiles and cinephiles alike, get back to some classic movies or simply find a starting point to watch some great films.

## How to Play:
1. Click "ready/start"
2. Pick your current mood
3. Choose from the prompts to find out what happens to your character and what movie best suits your mood.
4. You can click" reset" to return home.

## Stretch Goals:
1. Add alt tags to remaining images
2. Add animation and audio
3. Add links to trailers for moodvie recommendations
4. Iterate through categories of movies specific to each mood so recommendations auto populate at the end of each path
